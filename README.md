# CPI-Inflation-Analysis

Overview

This project explores the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation trends across various demographic categories in India, focusing on rural and urban disparities. The analysis aims to identify expenditure patterns, correlations among various categories, and provide recommendations based on the findings.

Tools Used
Excel: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Objectives
Trend Analysis: To analyze CPI inflation trends across different expenditure categories including food, luxury goods, clothing, housing, and healthcare.
Correlation Identification: To determine correlations between various expenditure categories and the overall inflation index.
Rural vs. Urban Comparison: To compare the expenditure patterns and inflation rates between rural and urban populations.
Policy Recommendations: To provide insights and recommendations based on the analyzed data to inform economic policies.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from GOI website. It includes historical CPI data segmented into various categories for both rural and urban demographics.
Oil correlation data was found from other source ppac.goc.in


Key Findings
Food Expenditure: Represents 45-47% of total spending, with significant variations in categories like "Meat and Fish" and "Oils and Fats."
Luxury and Discretionary Spending: Trends indicate urban areas allocate more to luxury goods, while rural areas show higher spending on essentials.
Correlation Insights: Strong correlations were found in food-related categories, notably between "Oils and Fats" and overall inflation.
Urban vs. Rural Analysis: Urban households spend more on housing and education, while rural households allocate more to food.

Visualizations
The project includes various Excel visualizations that illustrate the findings, such as bar graphs and pie charts, which highlight spending behavior and inflation trends across categories.

Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of CPI inflation trends and expenditure behaviors, laying the groundwork for further research and informed economic policy decisions.
